Please implement a function
that computes the size of an xlist DIRECTLY:
//
fun xlist_size(xs: 'a xlist): int
//
That is, you should NOT convert xlist into list
and then compute the size of the converted list
//

use "./../assign01.sml";

fun xlist_size(xs: 'a xlist): int = 
(
case xs of 
xlist_nil => 0
| xlist_cons(x1, xs) => 1 + xlist_size(xs)
| xlist_snoc(xs, x1) => 1 + xlist_size(xs)
| xlist_append(xs, ys) => xlist_size(xs) + xlist_size(ys)
